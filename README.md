# react-calculator

## Today you will build your first complete project in [React](https://reactjs.org/)!
Your job is to create a basic calculator, similar to the one below in React.  

For this assignment, you won't be starting off with any source code, but can use any resource we've given thus far or anything that you can find in the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/) or the [Resources](#resources) section below.  

Start by planning out the overall architecture of your app. Remember that modularity is very important in React.  Then decide what your desired functionality will be, and what logic and functions you'll need to accomplish it.  

When you start writing your application, keep in mind style best practices.  Check out Techtonic's **[React Style-Guide](https://techtonicgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/185892955/Style+Guide?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiOTI0NjcwZmIwNmZlNDlmMjgxYmRmMDZkOWE2ZmQ5MmIiLCJwIjoiYyJ9)** that is currently in use on the floor. 

Your finished calculator should look roughly like the image below.  Don't worry about getting visual details pixel perfect, focus rather on the logic of the calculator and overall style of your application.
